### Running the Program

* Main class:
    * Main.java

* Data files needed:
    * Can optionally load in .slogo files in /data.

* Interesting data files:
    * The .slogo files that create different patterns are cool.

* Key/Mouse inputs:
    * Just mouse and keyboard input.

### Notes/Assumptions

* Assumptions or Simplifications:
    * We made the assumption that our turtle commands would not hit the edge of the screen. We
      currently do not handle when the turtle hits the edge.

* Known Bugs:
    * Replaying a rotate animation will update the turtle incorrectly in the view.

* Features implemented:
    * Turtle, SLogo parsing, command history, animation, interface customization, no-code.

* Features unimplemented:
    * Nested commands, user defined commands

* Noteworthy Features:
    * The animation, no-code, and interface customization highlight how modular our design is.
